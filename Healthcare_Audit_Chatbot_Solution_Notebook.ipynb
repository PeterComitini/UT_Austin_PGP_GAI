Performing these audits manually through traditional SQL queries is time-consuming as it requires help from the specialized technical teams, and often leads to delays in identifying compliance gaps, and operational inefficiencies. Audit professionals, while domain experts, are frequently hindered by their reliance on data teams or IT specialists to retrieve the insights they need.\n","\n","To address this challenge,**ClaimAudit AI** is building an AI-powered audit assistant that leverages Agentic AI to help audit teams query claims databases in plain language. The system dynamically translates natural queries into secure SQL execution, incorporates context from past queries for continuity, and applies guardrails against harmful or destructive inputs. By providing accurate, explainable, and real-time audit insights, the solution empowers audit professionals to focus on investigation and decision-making rather than technical data retrieval, ultimately improving efficiency."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CARPKFwm6Bz4"},"source":["## Objective"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dOElOEXq6Bz4"},"source":["The goal is to develop a prototype that demonstrates how Agentic AI can transform the way audit teams interact with healthcare claims data,accelerating the audit process.\n","\n","Specifically, the system aims to:\n","\n","* Enable audit professionals to query claims data in **natural language**, without needing technical expertise.\n","* Provide **accurate, explainable insights** by dynamically generating and executing safe queries.\n","* Support **contextual continuity** by remembering prior queries and enabling meaningful follow-ups.\n","* Ensure **responsible AI use** by applying guardrails to prevent harmful, destructive, or sensitive queries.\n","* Improve **efficiency and compliance oversight** by allowing audit teams to focus on investigation and decision-making instead of manual data retrieval.\n","\n","This case study focuses on building a small part of the broader solution - a chatbot that translates plain-language queries into actionable SQL, retrieves insights from claims databases, and generates clear, audit-ready responses.
